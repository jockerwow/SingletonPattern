# SingletonPattern

- Summary: A Creational Pattern, used with data structures where only a single initialization is needed in the application lifetime. 
- Logic: It depends on initializing the object only when it is null.
- Result: This results in improved performance (as initialization processes/footprint are not repeated with each initialization).
Although Static classes can produce similar result, you can not apply OOP practices on static classes, such as inhertiance, implementing interfaces, used in method params, .. etc. Static classes are better used with utility methods.

- The Project contains Two branches:
      1- legacy: With legacy code to show the code without implementing the pattern 
      2- master: with the pattern applied.
