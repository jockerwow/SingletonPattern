# SingletonPattern

- Summary: Used with data structures where only a single initialization is needed in the application. 
- Logic: It depends on initializing the object only when it is null.
- Result: This results in improved performance (as initialization processes/footprint are not repeated with each initialization)

- The Project contains Two branches:
      > Before: With legacy code 
      > master: with the pattern applied.
